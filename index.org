* WELCOME
This is my personal homepage/blog build with emacs org-mode. Don't forget to check out the terminal and the fancy 3D mode on the left corner.

I like to code in general, create music, 3D art and games. I also have a high interest in many areas of physics and math which I will also write about here.

This whole site is build from a CI pipeline that invokes emacs on a archlinux container building the static content. The source code for this whole blog can be found at [[https://github.com/matheusfillipe/myblog][this]] github repository. If you want to correct anything or ask anything [[https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests][PR's]] are welcome!

# LIST FEATURED BEGIN
- [[file:series/wave_propagation/1.org][]]       In this series I am going to try to create a simplified model for logitudinal pressure waves propagation on fluids based on the interaction between its particles. Or main goal is to go step by step on the physics behind it, solving problems that gradually increase complexity, to have a theoretical preview of the relationship between the fluid's density and the wave's speed.
