* My Blog!

This is the source code for my personal blog that can be found at: https://blog.mattf.tk/

This is probably the most bloated emacs org-publish blog ever made so get ready!!!

Every commit is automatically compiled by circleci using a [[https://archlinux.org/][archlinux]] image and running the build.sh script that invokes emacs compiling the .org files into html. The compiled html is then automatically deployed to [[https://www.netlify.com/][netlify]]'s CDN.
