#+TITLE: Wave propagation
#+DESCRIPTION: In this series I am going to try to create a simplified model for logitudinal pressure waves propagation on fluids based on the interaction between its particles. Or main goal is to go step by step on the physics behind it, solving problems that gradually increase complexity, to have a theoretical preview of the relationship between the fluid's density and the wave's speed.

Or main goal is to go step by step on the physics behind it, solving problems that gradually increase complexity, to have a theoretical preview of the relationship between the fluid's density and the wave's speed.
